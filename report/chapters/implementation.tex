\chapter{Implementation and running}

\section{Programs and Data Sets}
\subsection{Data generator}
''create\_data.py'', this program uses the Pyton Image Library to read the
images and output the data to a file called ''data.dta''. This file will in the
end contain all the pixel values of the scaled down images.  It will also save
the scaled down images to a separate folder as a new image, just for fun.

\subsection{Data verifier}
This is a fun little Python script which reads the data file generated by the
data generator.  The program is the ''checkData.py'' executable.  The program
will read the data sets and project the ''image'' of the data to the user. The
use of this program is to verify the data sets.

\subsection{ANN trainer program}
This program creates and trains the neural network by importing the data set
file and using this data for training. The program to be run is the ''main.cpp''
which contains the C++ source code for the program. It will trian the network
for x amount of times as specified by the source code. When the training is done
it will save the ANN to a file, ''savefile.net'' which is then used by the
testing program.

\subsection{ANN testing program}
The C++ file ''eval.cpp'' is the source code file for running the image data
sets through a saved neural network.  It will take the savefile generated from
the previously run ANN trainer program.  It will then run the set data sets and
classify the output from the output layer.


\subsection{Saved Files}
\paragraph{Image Data Sets}
''data2.dta'' is the image data set file generated by ''create\_data.py''. It is
used by the data verifier, ANN trainer program and the ANN testing program.

\paragraph{ANN Save File}
The files ''save\_0\_10.net'' and ''save\_11\_20.net'' is the saved files which was generated by the ANN trainer
program and is used by the ANN testing program.
	

\section{Running}
Compile the program using Visual Studio on Windows or g++ on Linux. This wil
compile the files and make an executable.  When using Visual Studio on Windows
make sure to correct all the file paths since it puts the output files to a
different directory than the source code directory.

On linux you can run the make tool to compile the programs. ''make learn'' will
create the ANN learning program, ''make test'' will create the ANN testing
program.
