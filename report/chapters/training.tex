\chapter{Neural Network Training and Testing}
\section{Training Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Load image data into data structure.
\item Generate fully connected feed-forward neural network.
\item Generate initial weights(synapses) for the entire network.
\item Select data set to use as input for network.
\item Propagate input values through the network.
\item Calculate output layer errors.
\item Calculate errors for the hidden layers.
\item Fix the weights in the network, according to the errors.
\item Repeat from step 4, until reached convergence and/or run the learning
	procedure 200.000 times.
\item Save all the weights to file.
\item Exit the program gracefully.
\end{enumerate}




\section{Testing Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Load image data into data structure.
\item Generate fully connected feed-forward neural network.
\item Generate initial weights(synapses) for the entire network using the saved
	file generated by the learning program.
\item Select data set to use as input to network.
\item Propagate input values through the network.
\item Classify the output information into reasonable data.
\item Display the generated classification data.
\item Repeat from step 4 until it has gone through each data set.
\item Exit program gracefully.
\end{enumerate}
