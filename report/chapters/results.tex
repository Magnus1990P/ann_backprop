\chapter{Results}

\section{Learning set 1-10}
The following tables shows the results from running our trainer and the output
classifier at 100.000 epochs using either the first 10 images as training set or
the last 10 images of each character as training set.

Then the results was gathered from the test program after running both the first
ten and last ten image sets against each of the two different stored neural
networks.

\section{Identification rate - Set 1-10}
The following tables shows out of x image sets ran through the network was
recognised as a character with 50\% or more reliability.
